This web app lets kids enter short sentences and detects the mood (happy, neutral, sad) with a kid-friendly emoji and a short explanation. It uses TextBlob for sentiment analysis and filters inappropriate language for safety.

## How Kids Learn
- Introduction to text classification and sentiment analysis.
- Hands-on experience with building interactive web apps using Streamlit.
- Understanding the importance of safety in online content.

## Teaching Plan (60 minutes)
- Explain sentiment analysis basics.
- Guide students to build and run the app.
- Show how the safety filter works.
- Encourage students to experiment with adding words or changing moods.

## Known Limitations
- Limited bad words filter.
- Simple sentiment analysis based on polarity.
- No advanced AI or heavy models used.
